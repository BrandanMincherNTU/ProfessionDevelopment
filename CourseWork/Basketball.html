				I chose to do Basketball as one of my extra curricular activities as it is something I enjoy personally and also I value health and exercise very highly and I think regularly exercising helps me focus on my work and have peace of mind. Basketball is a nice alternative to running which I used to do quite frequently however it can be boring so applying my cardio to an activity I enjoy is something I thought would be a good choice to use for my Continued Professional Development.
				<br></br>
				Basketball is also a team game which I valued highly when decided to play for my CPD as the purpose of CPD is also to progress socially and the team-work aspect of basketball is perfect for this. I had not played basketball in 4 years before I first went so I performed badly at first and have slowly improved. This is also a skill that can be learnt from sports the skill of being perseverant

				From sports I have learnt the skill how improving which can be tranferred to anything, I have found that it is most easily learn within sports as the objectives and overall goal are usually simple and the competition can inspire this attitude for improvement.  
				<br></br>
				A weakness of mine is social skills in large groups of people, at basketball there were around 30 people at each session and i play on the court with at least 8 people at once. With a common interest it is much easier for me to improve my social skills in large groups as there is always a topic. This will further help my professional career as I will have to interact with many people all the time in things such as projects working with large teams and iteracting with other teams in an organisation or presenting in front of large quantities of people.
				<br></br>
				Overall I think basketball was a success for my Continued Professional Development due to the skills I picked up and experiance as a whole was enjoyable and I plan to continue to play Basketball weekly when I am not busy on the days it occurs.
