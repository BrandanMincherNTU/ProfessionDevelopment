			<div  id="block1">I attended a Presentation about employability and a presentation on the Ethics of Biometrics and AI.The first Seminar I attended on the day was the Employability. When relecting on this Presentation I believe I learnt quite a lot from the presentation as a whole. The first thing I picked up on was the techniques and skills on presenting in general which is really helpful as I will have to present through out Univeristy and my profesional career. The format of the slides and pace of the speaking were two aspects that I picked up on and are currently applying this to my Presentation on "Edward Snowden Hero or Villian?". I also gained a lot of knowledge about resources that could help my employability and taking a path with an industry placement during my time at Univeristy </div>

			<div  id="block5"> The Second Seminar I attended really opened up my mind to the ethical considerations when advancing and implementing different technologies and how they affect us socially and culture as a whole. The team at Fujitsu helped me understand the different roles in their team and the importance of each of them to solve issues and that people from many different academic fields/backgrounds assist the team beyond just the technical aspect of the project. The topic was interesting and very important. The presentation made me question my beliefs on the topic and whether they were reasonable with the information they provided. The seminar was very useful for critical thinking skills which I will develop further for my profesional career.
