			<div  id="block1">The Continued Professional Development is about me progressing personally and profesionally at Univeristy and completing and attending different activies will help me achieve this. As a Student at Nottingham Trent University I have access to multiple different facilities and events. The purpose of this website is to compile my activities with evidence and my own thoughts with reflection on my progress with my activities and professional development as a whole. What counts as extracurricular activies? Stated on the CPD document on NTU NOW student but not excluded to societies, extra skills support, volunteering, course rep responsibilities and sports activities.</div>

			<div  id="block5">When Planning for my Continued Professional Development I knew I was going to choose to do certain activities. When chosing activies to do for the CPD I wanted to ensure that they provided the right experience in order to provide me with knowledge and experiance that would could progress my profesional development substaniatly while also being in activities I enjoy. Having a personal interest in the activies is a extremely important factor as enjoying the activity will mean I am more likely to engage and actual learn and progress my profesional development. For my CPD I took part in Seminars for CV development and Work Experiance and an AI and Surveillance Seminar. I also participated in Basketball as a sports activity and also attended a trip to Bletchley Park.</div>
