				The Univeristy Trip was to Blecthely Park the government institution which is know for the code breaking task for the employees there. Alan Turing a famous mathmematician who is responsable for the turing machine that managed to crack the enigma code that the Nazis used to convey messages for the radio.
				<br></br>
				Alan Turing made the turing machine the first programmable digital electronic computer which alowed the machine to be programmed to decifer the codes after the Nazis had changed the key of the code. Alan Turing's machine is also used to refer to Turing Complete which means a program or programming language that can be used to create a program that can solve any equation. On my trip we toured around the park and learnt a lot about the story of Blecthely Park and computer engineering at the time of WW2.

				The Trip was interesting for me because I had remember a film I had watched and really enjoyed The Imitation Game which is based on Alan Turing and his invention. On the site we were able to see a recreation of the bombe machine that was able to crack the engima code with many different documents of designs and concept. One thing I found interesting was the planning and designing element that went into the project. I knew a decent amount about Blecthely Park, Alan Turing and the Government Code and Cypher School but the trip expanded my knowledge with primary sources with supporting explinations. After the trip I had researched a little more into Bletchely Park.
				<br></br>
				The trip overall was very good I enjoyed visiting the Park and each sight/hut in the Park as they all held a lot of detailed information about WW2 and programming at the time which I have a personal interest in.
